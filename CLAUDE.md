# <PROJECT_NAME>

> TODO: One-line description of what this project is.

## Type
TODO — e.g. "Web app", "CLI tool", "Infrastructure repo", "Library".

## Stack
TODO — languages, frameworks, key dependencies.

## Structure
```
TODO — top-level directory layout
```

## Commands
```sh
TODO — build / dev / test / lint commands
```

## Notes
TODO — env vars, deployment, anything a future session needs to know that isn't obvious from the code.

## Working rules

These rules apply regardless of what's above. They mirror the operator's global
Claude Code configuration so this repo behaves consistently even if opened on a
different machine or by a collaborator.

### Language
- Chat responses: German
- Everything that goes into the repo — code, comments, commit messages, branch
  names, PR descriptions, CHANGELOG: English (default, more compact)
- Respect a project's already-established language convention if one exists

### Approach — get it right once instead of fixing it ten times
1. Fully understand the task before starting
2. Think through the solution: edge cases, error handling, dependencies, blast radius
3. Only then implement it completely and correctly

No placeholders. No `// TODO` without a resolution attached. No half-finished
implementations.

For larger tasks: use Plan Mode before writing code. If something is fundamentally
unclear and would change the direction of the solution, ask once rather than
building in the wrong direction.

### Coding rules
- TypeScript: no `any`, explicit types
- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Follow the project's existing conventions over these defaults when they conflict

### Git workflow
- Never commit directly to `main`/`master` — always a feature branch
- Branch names in English, kebab-case (`feat/...`, `fix/...`)
- Before every push: check `git status` and `git diff --staged`
- No `git push --force` on main/master

### Security
- `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.secret` — never read, log, or commit
- No credentials/tokens/passwords in code
- Secrets via environment variables or a secrets manager, never in plaintext

### Subagents — delegate proactively
Use these specialists without being asked each time, as soon as the situation fits:

- **test-runner** → right after writing or changing application code
- **security-reviewer** → after auth/input/dependency changes, and before any release
- **code-reviewer** → before a merge / after finishing a feature
- **debugger** → as soon as a test fails, a stack trace shows up, or behavior is unexpected

Run independent analyses (e.g. security + tests) in parallel. Skip subagents for
trivial changes — the overhead isn't worth it.
